### Project Overview

#### Objective:

Automate the deployment of Jira Data Center on AWS using Kubernetes, with infrastructure and configuration managed by Terraform.

#### Key Components:

1. **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Cloud platform hosting the Kubernetes cluster and related infrastructure.
2. **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.
3. **Jira Data Center**: The application to be deployed, running within the Kubernetes cluster.
4. **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources in AWS.
5. **Central Repository**: A Git repository hosting all the code for infrastructure, configuration, and deployment scripts.
6. **Build Pipelines**: Utilize Github Actions to automatically create the infrastructure and deploy the application.

#### Deployment Flow:

1. **Infrastructure Setup in AWS**: Use Terraform to define and create the necessary AWS infrastructure for running Kubernetes. This includes setting up the network, compute resources, and any other required services.
2. **Kubernetes Cluster Configuration**: Deploy a Kubernetes cluster on the AWS infrastructure. This step is also managed with Terraform.
3. **Deployment Automation**: Automate the deployment process of Jira Data Center onto the Kubernetes cluster. This involves pulling the Jira container image and deploying it to Kubernetes.
4. **Version Control and Code Management**: All the code for infrastructure setup (Terraform), configuration (Ansible), and deployment scripts are maintained in a central Git repository. This allows for version control, collaboration, and a single source of truth for the entire deployment process.
5. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment, ensuring seamless updates and maintenance of the application and infrastructure.
